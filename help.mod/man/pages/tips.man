=== Use -d flag for development

The *jam -d* flag enables a lot of useful features
for development.

When enabled, jam prints a lot of debug info
in the console and extracts help metadata
from the browser.

So, online help (F1) works only with -d flag.

=== Use --release flag when packing for production

With *--release* flag all development features
will be ignored and will not be included
in the final package.
